READ ME FILE FOR CEE 6755 PROJECT 1
===================================

CEE 6755 Project 1 Tom√°s Schmieder

This is my read me file.

The important files to look at are:

- STEP1-CODE.ipynb
- STEP2-CODE.ipynb
- STEP3-CODE.ipynb
- step1.msh
- step2.msh
- step3.msh
- step3_template.msh
- step1.i
- step2.i
- step2part2i
- step3.i
- step3_template.i
- Project 1 - CEE6755 - Tomas Schmieder.pdf

The .i files are our input files which are then optimized and solved using the .ipynb files.

By the names the .ipynb files are the code files that result in the plots.

The .msh files are, you guessed it, the mesh files, open these up in Gmsh to see what they look like, images of them are also in the pdf file.

The .pdf file is the writeup that has the plots, answers, and all the results of the project
